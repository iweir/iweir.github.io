I am a Research Associate/Senior Biostatistician at the Center for Biostatistics in AIDS Research at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I am designing randomized controlled trials with the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) in Tuberculosis; specifically trials of treatment shortening regimens. 

My methodological research is focused on time-to-event outcomes. I am a proponent of using measures of treatment effect based on the restricted mean survival times as an alternative to the hazard ratio. I also have an interest in challenges of non-inferiority trials. 

Please see the respective sections of this webpage for information about my publications, software, and an up to date copy of my CV.
