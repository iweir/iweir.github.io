I am a Research Associate/Senior Biostatistician at the Center for Biostatistics in AIDS Research at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I am designing randomized controlled trials with the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) in Tuberculosis. 

My methodological research focuses on innovation for randomized controlled trials with time-to-event outcomes. In particular, I have focused on methods with the difference in restricted mean survival times as an alternative, or supplemental measure, to the hazard ratio. 

Please see the respective sections of this webpage for information about my publications, software, and an up to date copy of my CV.
